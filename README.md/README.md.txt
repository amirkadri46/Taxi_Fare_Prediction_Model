Taxi Fare Prediction Model
Overview:
A machine learning model to predict taxi fares using Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. 
The project includes feature engineering, PCA for dimensionality reduction,
and end-to-end pipeline optimization to improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Key Features:
1. Feature Engineering: Engineered temporal (hour, day), spatial (distance metrics), and contextual features from raw data.
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to streamline feature space while retaining 95% variance.
3. Model Optimization: Compared performance of Random Forest (higher accuracy) vs. Decision Tree (faster inference) after hyperparameter tuning.
4. Data Preprocessing: Handled outliers, missing values, and encoded categorical variables for robust training.
